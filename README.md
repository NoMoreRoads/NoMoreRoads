## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zach Lesher (he/him) and I am a data scientist-in-training! Nice to meet you!

I am passionate about low-carbon cities, music, and anime & manga. The projects you see here will likely reflect those interests in some fashion!

I am currently working on a project using user-generated data from the media cataloging service [AniList](https://anilist.co) to predict the target demographic of a piece of media.

Outside of this, you can find me biking around my home city looking for new cafÃ©s and bakeries. ðŸš²â˜•ðŸ¥§

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-lesher-6252072a6/) if you'd like to know more about my professional and educational background!
